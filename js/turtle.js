/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Object Turtle is a LOGO style turtle for drawing on a HTML canvas 2d context
 *
 * @name Turtle
 * @author John Snyders
 * @license BSD
 * @version 0.1
 */

/**
 * @class
 * Construct a Turtle object.
 * <p>The turtle starts off at the origin (0,0) heading 0 degrees which is east.
 * The initial pen color (style) is black and solid and the initial width is 2.
 * There are 360 degrees to a circle. The units for distance and pen width are
 * the same as for the 2d context.</p>
 *
 * <p>The turtle will use whatever context settings are in effect such as
 * lineCap, globalAlpha etc. except for penWidth and penStyle
 * which are maintained independently by the turtle.
 * lineJoin will have no effect because each linear motion of the turtle
 * is a seperate path.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any transformations on the canvas will confuse the clear method.</p>
 *
 * <p>All turtle methods return the turtle so that you can chain method calls.</p>
 * <h3>Example:<h3>
 * @example
 * <pre>
 * var t = new jjs.Turtle(canvas);
 * t.penDown().forward(10).right(90).forward(10).right(90).forward(10)
 *   .right(90).forward(10);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param canvas a canvas element. The caller must make sure the canvas supports a 2d context.
 * @constructor
